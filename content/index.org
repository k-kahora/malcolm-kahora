** My keyboards of choice

- [[https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep][Ferris Sweep]] : My first ergo board, very fun to use. The low profile makes this thing very snappy.
- [[https://bastardkb.com/product/charybdis-mini-kit/][Charybdis Mini]] : Absolute hell to build due to the flexible PCB, but my most comfortable keyboard. The trackball makes this thing a bulldozer when it comes to getting things done on a computer.
- [[https://www.boardsource.xyz/products/microdox][Microdox]] : A very cramped keyboard, but using the nice!nanos for Bluetooth is what makes this the board I choose when working outside my room.
