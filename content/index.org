* Welcome

The purpose of this site is to display my portfolio.  These include all my past procts as well as all relevant accomplishments.  The site is nothing fancy, it is generated via org-mode.  A markdown like language in Emacs that exports easily to html.  This way I can keep the site simple while having it focus on my work.
