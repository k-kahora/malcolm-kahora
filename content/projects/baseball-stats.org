In order to prepare for the next hackathon I wanted to learn a new technology and D3.js caught my interest.  I made this project to prep for the event.  If takes a static csv file about baseball stats and categorize them by team.  You can also choose what stat to graph with the ui tool above.  Hovering over a portion of the graph will show what team is represented there you can click it to zoom in.
