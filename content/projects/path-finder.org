In 2021 our school hosted a hackathon.  I had experince in Java and was interested in path-finding alogorithim's.  The goal of this project was to create a map of our campus and find the best path between two points.  However due to time limitation's we ended up bastically making a pathfinding GUI tool.

Control's

- If node is selected place a node with a button press
- Connect two nodes by dragging a line between them with path selected.
- Set a start and end-point =Click= generate to find the best path.
